AI Sprite Packer Cases
============


Select File -> New  / Clear Button
=====
Should clear the canvas and set it to the canvas width/height

If the canvas width or height is contains invalid values a warning will pop up
Canvas width/height text box will highlight in red if the values are invalid

Select File -> Import
====

Selecting an invalid file type will crash the application (.txt, .exe, etc.)

Selecting a single file should import it after the last imported image unless it is the first

Selecting multiple images will import all of the selected images after the last imported image unless it's the first import

Selecting multiple files types that include a non image format will crash the application

Importing a large number of sprites may spill out of the canvas. You may still export from this position,
but it will squish the sprites within the current canvas size. To avoid the compressed export, simply resize the
canvas to fit the sprites included

You may currently import images if the canvas width/height is set to (0 , 0)


Select File -> Export  /  Export Button
=====

Will export a named .png and .xml file

If you save a png with the same file name as another .png
it will prompt if you wish to override the .png but not the xml
The xml will be overidden along with the .png if you accept

Canvas Width / Height
=======

The canvas text boxes are looking for a number to set the canvas width and height to respectively.

A non integer value will cause a warning to pop up when trying to Clear the canvas or create a New one

A non integer value will cause the textbox to highlight in red

Setting the Width/Height of the canvas to a size larger than the window will cause scroll bars to appear

Drag/Drop
=======
Dragging images works similarly to importing

Images cannot be dropped in the grey area, this is not considered the canvas

If the canvas is not visible (no white space) you will not be able to drag and drop images

Dragging in files that are not images will cause the program to crash

Window
======

Resizing the window should not resize the canvas only the viewer it's contained in
